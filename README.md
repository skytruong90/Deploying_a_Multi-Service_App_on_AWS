# Multi-Service Web Application Deployment on AWS

## Introduction

Hello! This project is focusing on deploying a multi-service web application using various technologies and practices. Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of deploying and managing web applications on the cloud, specifically on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Project Overview

The core of this project involves creating a simple yet functional web application that consists of a front-end interface and a database backend. The front-end serves as the user interface, while the backend handles data storage and retrieval. To make this setup more interesting and challenging, I'm using Docker containers to package each part of the application, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### What I'm Learning

- **Docker:** How to containerize applications, making them portable and consistent across different environments.
- **Terraform:** Utilizing Infrastructure as Code to provision and manage AWS resources efficiently and in a repeatable manner.
- **Ansible:** Automating the configuration of servers and other infrastructure components to ensure they meet the required specifications.
- **Git:** Employing version control to manage changes to the project codebase, facilitating collaboration and tracking of the project's evolution.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate the testing and deployment of the application.

### Objectives

- **Deploy a Multi-Service Application:** Demonstrate the ability to launch a complex application consisting of multiple interconnected services.
- **Utilize DevOps Tools and Practices:** Show proficiency in using key DevOps tools and practices to automate the setup, deployment, and management of infrastructure and applications.
- **AWS Cloud Infrastructure:** Gain practical experience with AWS services, focusing on how to leverage the cloud to deploy scalable and secure applications.
- **Monitoring and Scaling:** Learn to implement monitoring solutions to track application performance and use this data to scale the application as needed.

## Note:

Think of this project as a way to build a digital structure where everything is automated. Just like in a modern building where lighting, heating, and security systems operate automatically for efficiency and comfort, here we're making the digital components of a web application work together seamlessly and automatically adjust to demands.

This journey is about learning the best ways to construct these digital structures in the cloud, ensuring they're secure, efficient, and can adapt as needs change. By the end of this project, I aim to have a solid foundation in deploying and managing online applications, which is a valuable skill in today's digital world.

## Conclusion

I hope this README provides a clear understanding of what I'm working on and why it's important. Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
